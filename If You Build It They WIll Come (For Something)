An important lesson to remember is that if you are lucky enough to build something people want to use - don't be surprised if they end up using your product for something you didn't expect or anticipate. 

The classic example of this is SMS test messaging. Originally developed by mobile carriers to send customer service messages, individuals soon started sending messages to each other instead. So unexpected was this development that the mobile carriers didn't even have the ability the charge people for this service. This is just one of many real-life examples where one feature you never expected would be popular comes to be essential for your service. 

This means that when building your product you need to first be able to measure what people are doing in your application or software. This may sound obvious, but I have seen firsthand people launch products without the ability to measure the usage of their own features. With this data you can be empowered to make data-driven choices about what to develop, change, or get rid off.

Always remember to talk to the customers. Emails and data are nice, but hearing the voice of the customer explain why and how they use your service can be much more persuavice and insightful. Having the ability to listen has to be built into your culture with feedback mechasims that reach your product decision makers. 

Have a design and back-end that is flexible and won't break when you make changes. This means that if you are launching, consider using services that do alot of the hard stuff for you already - like a squarespace, shopify, and stripe. This will allow you and your team to focus on the features that you are bringing that are truely value-add, and will eliminate the pain if you discover the gem in your product that you need to build on.
