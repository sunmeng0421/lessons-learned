# Mobile Site or Mobile App?

One of the first lessions we learned in Digital Literacy for Decision Makers, was knowing whether to build a mobile application or a mobile website.

Mobile website make regular websites more accessible for mobile users.  They can look and feel the same as the website, but will also feature a mobile optimized layout with functionality specifically designed for mobile users.

Mobile apps need to be downloaded and installed by users.  However, businesses have more control over their presence on a device than if they just launched a mobile website. Apps can allow geo-targeted push notifications to be sent and data to be gathered about a customer.

It you want something more mobile specific, there are three ways you can go to build an app:

1) PhoneGap ($)– This is a tool that allows you to take a front end website and package it into an app that can be installed on phones.  Though it won’t look or feel exactly like a native application, it is an easy way to prototype a mobile app quickly and deliver it on multiple platforms. This will cost approximately $25,000.

2) Titanium Appcelerator ($$)– This tool is ideal when you need to build an app quickly that looks and feels similar to a native app on iOS and Android.  This will cost on average, 30% more than PhoneGap.

3) Native Application ($$$)– This is written in the language of the phone.  It provides the absolute best performance but takes more time and is much more expensive.  This will cost on average $50,000.


The takeaway presented in class is that you should always try to build a mobile website first.  

Additionally, you should always start with your business objective: What are you trying to achieve by building your mobile presence? Once you decide where you want to go and what you want to achieve, you'll have a better idea about what you need your product to accomplish.  From there, you can decide whether a mobile website or mobile application is right for you.
